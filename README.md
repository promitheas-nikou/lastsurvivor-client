## Last Survivor Client *(may be renamed in the future)*


**Last Survivor** is a 2D open-and-dynamically-generated-world sandbox game, where the player can explore the infinite world, harness its resources, and build powerful weapons, tools or machinery to automate a wide range of industrial processes.

> This game is still being heavily worked on, not all core mechanics have been implemented yet, and any feature may be changed or removed in the future.

This project is (theoretically) cross-platform, but is only tested and designed for windows, although no platform-specific features are used.

Github Releases with precompiled windows binaries are planned to come soon-ish.
